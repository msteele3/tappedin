# Tapped In: Reclaim Your Instagram Experience

Tired of endless scrolling through Instagram's curated content? Want to focus on genuine connections with your friends? Tapped In is the Chrome extension you need.

## About Tapped In
Tapped In is designed with a simple yet powerful goal: to eliminate doomscrolling on Instagram. It achieves this by transforming your Instagram experience, allowing you to access only your Direct Messages (DMs).

## How Tapped In Works
- **Streamlined Access**: Tapped In hides all other sections of Instagram (feed, stories, reels, etc.), leaving you with a clean interface focused solely on your DMs.
- **Mindful Interaction**: By removing distractions, Tapped In encourages mindful interaction with your friends and loved ones through direct messaging.
- **Easy Installation**: Setting up Tapped In takes just a few minutes (see instructions below).
